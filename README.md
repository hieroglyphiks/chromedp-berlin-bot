i hate berlin appointments

This is a small pretty hacky bot I wrote to work with the chrome developer protocol to look for appointments at the Berlin LEA/Auslanderbehorde because Berlin has legitimately the most unusable appointment system in the world.

In theory I disapprove of botting in general especially when its a necessary resource to those without the ability to do so, but I needed an appointment to keep my work authorization and this is what I made to get one.

It's not really built to be used by everyone but if you do want to use it, all you have to do is swap some of the fields like desired country and some of the options depending on what type of VISA you need an appointment for. I'm only open sourcing this in the first place because there are already companies out there charging money for their botted appointments, and if you need an appointment but can't afford that you deserve all the help you can get.
